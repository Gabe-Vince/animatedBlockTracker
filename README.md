# Real-Time Blockchain Animation with Viem and Rive React

Welcome to this tutorial! This project focuses on creating dynamic, real-time animations that respond to live changes on the blockchain. We'll be using Viem to listen for these changes and the Rive React Runtime library to handle our animations.

## What Will You Learn?

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

1. **Understand how to use Viem** to listen to on-chain changes in real-time. Viem is a fantastic tool for real-time blockchain data, and we'll show you how to get up and running with it.

2. **Manipulate animations with Rive and React**. Rive is a powerful animation tool with a runtime library for React, making it easy to integrate these animations into a modern web app.

3. **Combine these technologies** to create a web app that listens for on-chain changes and triggers animations in response. It's a unique way to visualize blockchain activity and a great example of combining data streams and UI.

## What is This Tutorial About?

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple web app that displays information about the latest block on the Ethereum blockchain.

But it's not just a data display. Each time a new block is mined, our app will play a fun animation, making the rather dry process of block mining a visually engaging experience!

## Who is This For?

This tutorial is aimed at developers with some experience in React and a basic understanding of blockchain technology. It's perfect for those looking to expand their knowledge and learn how to incorporate real-time blockchain data into a web app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework with a range of features for modern web development.
- **Viem**: A tool for real-time blockchain data.
- **Rive**: A platform for interactive, real-time animations.
- **Rive-React Runtime library**: A library for integrating Rive animations into a React app.
- **framer-motion**: A powerful library for controlling animations in React, enabling fluid visual transitions and user interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces, allowing fine control over design elements.

With these tools, we'll be able to create a dynamic, real-time web app that beautifully visualizes on-chain events. So let's get started!
